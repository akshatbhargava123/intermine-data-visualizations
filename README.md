# ‚≠êÔ∏è Project Report: <b>Google Summer of Code 2019 @Intermine</b>

## üí• Project Description:

> The current InterMine interface is powered by JSPs (example: http://www.flymine.org) and will be discontinued in the next few years. InterMine is already building a new interface named BlueGenes which is a web interface to query & view data from 30+ mines worldwide from same familiar interface.

<p class="aim">
The project aimed to develop standalone data visualization tools for BlueGenes which could possibly be useful to biologists using the interface.
</p>

## üòÅ What I developed?

<p class="viz-heading">‚õ≥Ô∏è Visualization 1: <b>Tissue Expression Visualizer</b></p>

- _Tissue Expression Visualizer_ can help users (biologists) to visualize tissue expression values and tissue expression by stage values with help of expression graphs.

- They easily can let you know which tissues are up-regulated, down-regulated or normal.

- It provides a clear interface to sort and filter data. Also, expression by stage graph clearly depicts higher expression values on later stages and lower ones earlier based on colour shades.

Code Repository: https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes-tissue-expression-visualizer

NPM Module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@intermine/bluegenes-tissue-expression-visualizer

<p class="viz-heading">‚õ≥Ô∏è Visualization 2: <b>3D Protein Visualizer</b></p>

- _3D Protein Visualizer_ helps visualize protein structures in different types of viewer in 3D. Users can select the PDB (Protein Data Bank) id they want to visualize and the visualizer fetches them from the RCSB data source.
